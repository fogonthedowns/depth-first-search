Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:
    1. DFS - The idea is to visit each leaf with the DFS strategy, while updating the minimum depth when we reach the leaf node.

    Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
    Space Complexity: O(n)
